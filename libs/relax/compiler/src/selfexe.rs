//! The program's own executable under the JIT: a hard link of the loader named as the program,
//! `<run dir>/exe/<loader key>/run/<name>` (`<name>.exe` on Windows), which the program's argv[0]
//! and std::env::current_exe() name. A spawn of that path runs this program again (std
//! process_unix.rs / process_windows.rs `self_exec_args`: RELAX_SELF_EXEC starts with it); a spawn
//! of the loader by any other name (RELAX_LOADER, an installed `makepad`) runs the loader's command
//! line as written, whatever its first word. A hard link, not a symlink or a copy: canonicalize
//! keeps its name, the OS runs it as the loader (the same file, so the same code signature on
//! macOS), and it takes no space beyond a directory entry while the loader file exists. A run dir
//! on another volume than the loader's links a copy of the loader there instead, one per loader
//! file (`link_loader`).
//!
//! The link is made once per loader file and program name, and every run of that program shares
//! it. The loader key names the folder (`loader_key`: the file's volume, number, length and last
//! write, so a rebuilt loader has another), and `same_file` says whether a link there is the
//! loader's file. No warm start makes a link: on macOS a new hard link of a file makes syspolicyd
//! scan the file again at its next exec, which held each exec of a 76 MB loader about 330 ms, and
//! now and then the process was killed in that wait. The folder of a loader file that was replaced
//! goes once no run of it is alive (`sweep`, when a link is made).
//!
//! A run is an entry in its link's folder, `+run/<pid>`: its command line (RELAX_SELF_EXEC's
//! words) and where its build environment is. A launch of the link that did not come through Relax
//! std's spawn (`sh -c "exec $EXE ..."`, a C library's exec: its arguments do not start with a
//! run's line) runs that run's program again, as std's spawn would have, built with that run's
//! build environment whatever environment the shell gave it (`relaunched`, `relaunch_build`,
//! relax issue 172). Its run is the one whose build environment's descriptor it holds, else its
//! nearest ancestor that is a run of the link, else the only live one; with none it says so and
//! ends. A test's package binary that a launcher clearing the environment (`env -i`) started
//! through its CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name> wrapper takes its test's run's build environment the same way
//! (`prepared_build`, relax issue 205). The environment is never in a file: it holds the person's
//! tokens, and a run that is killed leaves its entry. On Unix the run keeps it in a file that has
//! no name, by a descriptor an exec keeps, and the entry says which (`hand_build`); on Windows it
//! is `+run/<pid>.build`, which goes with the run's last handle.
//!
//! A test's links are laid out as cargo lays out target/<profile>: its executable in a `deps/`
//! folder and the package's binaries (their CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name> launchers) in the folder above it
//! (`add_bins`), so a test that finds a binary at `current_exe()/../../<name>`, as under cargo,
//! finds it (relax issue 139's second case). That folder is `t-<key>` (`test_key`: of what the
//! launchers' words hold), so a test run with other flags keeps its own binaries. On Windows a
//! binary there is `<name>.exe`, a link of the loader whose run's command line is in the folder's
//! `+bin` (`bin_start`).
//!
//! A process gets its program's name from the file it starts from (Linux's comm, macOS's p_comm:
//! what ps, top and a parent lookup show), as a cargo-built program has its own. So whoever starts
//! a run starts it from a link of the loader named as the program (`launch_link`, in the loader
//! key's `+launch` folder, shared as well): `makepad test` its targets' runs, a restart in place
//! the run again. A starter's `+launch/+run/<pid>` keeps the folder while the starter lives.
//!
//! A run removes its entry when it exits (os::proc::exit); a killed run's entry goes when the next
//! run of that program registers.
